The mind of Christ of in you enables you tap into the multi-dimensional realms, realities, creations, and also experience them here on earth. 

The mind of Christ in you gives you the privilege of access into the deeper things of God and the POWERS OF THE AGES to come.

The mind of Christ of in you opens you up to the creative dimension of the Father of lights. The mind of Christ doesn't just makes you a good christian but it makes you Christ on earth, doing and living in his mind.

Without the mind of Christ you can't walk in the powers of the ages to come.

When the DNA of God entered into you, your mind and pattern of thoughts was dis-configured so you can come into a proper alignment with the purposes of the Father revealed or captured in the mind of Christ.

The mind of Christ allows you experiencing all that Christ is, all that he has done and all that he has filled when he filled all things.

"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ". note
